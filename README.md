### Player controls : ✅

| z | Forward |
| q | Left |
| s | Back |
| d | Right |
| left mouse | Shoot |
| space | Jump |

### Bullets : ✅

Bullets are green blooming cube with a rigidbody, I make them spawn at a spawn point placed in front of the gun and I give them some inertia.

### Life bar for player: ❌

I have a rainbow bar ^^, but I want a gradient that will go from blue to green.

## Next steps

 - add some more type of bullets (curved trajectory type, auto aim type, ...)
 - add bullets self-destruction when they hit something (exception made later)
 - add a shield system (front shield, sphere shield, ...)
 - add life system (no mana/ammo since bullet will be shooted with life)
 - add swords
 - add walk on wall
 - add multiplayer
 - add team system
 - add time limit
 - add damage when hit
 - add extra weapons (invisibility, bouncing on air, dummies, teleportation, x-ray vision, ...)
 - add interaction between weapon (bullets can bounce off
