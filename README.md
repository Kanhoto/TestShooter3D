## Current version

### Player controls : ✅

| Key | Action |
|--|--|
| z | Forward |
| q | Left |
| s | Back |
| d | Right |
| left mouse | Shoot |
| space | Jump |

### Bullets : ✅

Bullets are just sphere mesh with a rigidbody, I make them spawn at a spawn point placed in front of the gun and I give them some inertia.

### Trion stats for player: ❌

Didn't even start but suppose it won't be the hardest part.

## Next steps

 - add some more type of bullets (curved trajectory type, auto aim type, ...)
 - add a shield system (front shield, sphere shield, ...)
 - add life system (no mana/ammo since bullet will be shooted with life)
 - add swords
 - add walk on wall
 - add multiple jump (cost energy)
 - add multiplayer
