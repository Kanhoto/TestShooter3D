## Current version

### Player controls : ❌ (don't work)

| Key | Action |
|--|--|
| z | Forward |
| q | Left |
| s | Back |
| d | Right |
| left mouse | Shoot |
| space | Jump |

### Bullets : ❌ (don't work)

Bullets are just sphere mesh with a rigidbody, I make them spawn at a spawn point placed in front of the gun and I give them some inertia.

## Next steps

 - Trying to shoot some bullets
 - add some more type of bullets (curved trajectory type, auto aim type, ...)
 - add a shield system
 - add life system (no mana/ammount since bullet will be shooted with life)
 - add swords
 - add walk on wall
